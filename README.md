# Query Optimisation using Quantum Algorithms for DBMS by formulating it as QUBO

This repository contains quantum and classical algorithms to solve the join ordering problem in DBMS. 
It includes an experimental dataset, method implementation, and solving join ordering using both classical heuristics and quantum variational algorithms.
